            <h3>violation, 10/19/25</h3>
            <p>We have another ceasefire violation.</p>
            <p>Why are we allowing the eradication of a nation?</p>
            <p>Palestinians, the descendants of the original melting pot, Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>Not that it matters, none of this should be happening to any human.</p>
        <br>
            <p>Name a hundred people you know and imagine that they're dead.</p>
            <p>Even one or two civilians are enough, the Palestinians are struggling to be fed.</p>
            <p>Traumatized children and babies birthed under rubble.</p>
            <p>Starving for a bit of milk from a malnourished mothers nipple.</p>
<br>
            <p>Withholding food and medicine from the young, sick, and disabled; fear of a group of rebel farmers.</p>
            <p>By doing so, Israel killed their own hostages, permanent marker.</p>
            <p>Destroying historical landmarks older than the state of Israel.</p>
            <p>Honestly, just give it up already. Jerusalem is not for sale.</p>
<br>
            <p>Israel has become worst than Hitler and Pharoah.</p>
            <p>Keep trying to wrestle with God, Israel's foe.</p>
            <p>What God wouldn't punish bloodthirsty savages. </p>
            <p>God of Abraham, make sure they pay for all the damages.</p>
<br>
            <p>For destroying hope for peace and justice between all mankind.</p>
            <p>I'm ashamed to be of the same species, peace in death I shall find.</p>

            <h3>transgression, 6/20/25</h3>

            <p>I've overstepped boundaries that shouldn't be crossed</p>
            <p>Im trying to redeem myself, I'm at a loss</p>
            <p>I'm destined for hell, my actions are a tool</p>
            <p>Everything I do is self serving, don't be fooled</p>
<br>
            <p>Since Hell is my destination, the present moment is heaven</p>
            <p>I have nothing else to lose, please take this as a lesson</p>
<br>
            <p>"I know God is watching" a young man once said</p>
            <p>While I gobble up all of my family's bread</p>
            <p>Could I survive with the same dignity as them?</p>
            <p>Honestly, Palestinians are humanity's gems.</p>
<br>
            <p>I'm a hypocrite, a glutton for smoke</p>
            <p>It's the main reason why I'm jobless and broke</p>
            <p>Consider this my public confession</p>
            <p>Whether it matters to you, sorry for the interruption </p>
            <p>I'm doing what I can, whatever is in my reach</p>
            <p>You know I'm kinda dumb, everything I learn i try to teach</p>
<br>
           <p>How do I perceive my own humanity? Im nothing but weak</p>
           <p>Excuses to keep smoking. Gods trust in me, breached</p>
<br>
            <p>But i refuse to lose hope, God gave us everything we need</p>
            <p>Whatever i spend my time doing, i'll take caution and heed</p>
<br>
            <p>Transgression and being alive means I have a chance</p>
            <p>Bit by bit, the outcomes i can still be enhance</p>
<br>
            <p>No one can solve my problems for me</p>
            <p>Standing alone with sins to atone, I'll bend my knee</p>
<br>
            <p>I gotta keep pushing, I gotta race to do good</p>
            <p>Attempt my best without eating the fruit</p>
<br>
            <p>All i want is to make a positive change</p>
            <p>To live with meaning, not in a social cage</p>
           <p>To die with pride and a smile on my face</p>
            <p>And to be buried without leaving a single trace</p>

                <p> Balance is everything, so they say</p>
                <p> Yet all I look forward to is pay day</p>
                    <br>
                <p> Money, corruption, greed, and vice</p>
                <p> Accepting this every day, can't be nice</p>
                    <br>
                <p> Too much work, not enough time</p>
                <p> Is this how we should be living, at our current prime?</p>
                <p> Family, friendship, love, actualization</p>
                <p> When will we get to the realization</p>
                <p> That we shouldn't live like this</p>
                <p> That we shouldn't live like this</p>
                    <br>
                <p> We can do better</p>
                <p> We have enough</p>
                <p> The past created pyramids without a computer</p>
                <p> Yet all we have to offer are electric scooters</p>
                    <br>
                <p> What can we do to unlock our potential</p>
                <p> In order to prove ourselves to the existential</p>
                    <br>
                <p> Happiness, pain, anger, sadness</p>
                <p> They don't matter too much against the madness</p>
                <p> To stay steady or lose our shit</p>
                <p> It's alright, go on, take another hit</p>
                    <br>
                <p> Dear mom,</p>
                <p> I'm sorry I hurt you when I was born</p>
                <p> It was not light, like a prick of a thorn</p>
                <p> I'm sorry I hurt you every day of my life</p>
                <p> Whenever I don't listen, practicing my own strife</p>
                <p> You are the world to me</p>
                <p> A place in this world, the gift to be</p>
                <p> I'll do my absolute best</p>
                <p> As I encounter these many tests</p>
                <p> I'll do you proud</p>
                <p> Til it reaches the cloud</p>

                <p> We understand each other you see</p>
                <p> We reflect one another's thoughts and feelings to a T</p>
                <p> How insecure we are in the face of God and our own existence</p>
                <p> Feeling like we're God's regret, shame, and embarrassment, for instance</p>
                <p> Neither of us want to be alone</p>
                <p> With the gravity of sins we have to atone</p>
                <p> We're a bit lost, as you can see</p>
                <p> We just want to scream, I just want to be me.</p>
                <p> We set the bar kinda high for ourselves</p>
                <p> Responsibility of our actions, before the ringing of the bells</p>
                <p> Not enough not enough not enough</p>
                <p> Now we're numb, apathetic, stubborn, and tough</p>
                <p> What does God have in store for us, I wonder</p>
                <p> I won't know til the time comes, so there's no need to ponder</p>
                <p> Continuing on, just doing our best</p>
                <p> Appreciation for the right to exist and taking of the test</p>

            <h3>Dear God, 10/22/22</h3>
                <p>Prejudice has been around since the beginning of time</p>
                <p>Ever since the angels and jinn were at their prime</p>
                <p>God created humans, it confused even the "best"</p>
                <p>Now we have a whole prejudice mess</p>
                <p>All of us have been created by God</p>
                <p>Isn't that enough, for us to work together as a pod?</p>
                <p>None of us are perfect, we can all agree, God holds that position</p>
                <p>Harmony may be what He is waiting for, not juxtaposition</p>
                <p>Love despite each other's flaws</p>
                <p>Rather than hatred and bearing of claws</p>
                <p>This is only my viewpoint of course</p>
                <p>I can't be certain, only God knows the course</p>
                <p>Assumptions I'm making against tradition</p>
                <p>God willing, He'll understand my condition</p>
                <p>For the chair of justice and mercy is his position</p>
                <p>Like you, I've experienced both</p>
                <p>But now it feels like a ghost</p>
                <p>I'm astray, due to my behavior</p>
                <p>Attempts at good character and intentions may be my only savior</p>
                <p>Even then, it all comes from God</p>
                <p>Full faith and trust must at least gain a nod</p>
                <p>I'm struggling, God knows best</p>
                <p>I hope he will help me clean up my mess when he addresses the press</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Dear God, please have mercy on us</p>
                <p>But enforce your justice when you must</p>
                <p>I don't understand justice, I'm not in the position to decide</p>
                <p>It's confusing and strange to me, when mercy and justice don't coincide</p>
                <p>It's your job alone I believe</p>
                <p>But how do we establish order by your leave?</p>
                <p>Is it something we should worry about</p>
                <p>He taught me, as you know, worry is a sign of doubt</p>
                <p>I owe him in a way</p>
                <p>Please help me compensate the pay</p>
                <p>Beneficent God, you know all</p>
                <p>Is he praying for us at all?</p>
                <p>I'm a hypocrite, he taught me the prayer</p>
                <p>Yet here I am, always saying later</p>
                <p>Inshallah he has good intentions</p>
                <p>I don't know for certain, but I'm sure he has some to mention?</p>
                <p>It's between you and him, I shouldn't intervene</p>
                <p>But from my impression, he didn't seem so mean</p>
                <p>Of course you know best</p>
                <p>Maybe we're both being put to the test</p>
                <p>I'm sorry to even ask, but please help us clean up our mess</p>
                <p>Someone is upset I think</p>
                <p>Every now and then, I feel we're on the brink</p>
                <p>Whoever is right or wrong, doesn't seem to matter</p>
                <p>Why risk everything to prove a point to the</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Dear God, please protect me</p>
                <p>A source of good, I'm hoping you'll let me be</p>
                <p>My thoughts and assumptions all over the place</p>
                <p>Feeling like I'm part of some sort of race</p>
                <p>Turtle bunny, you make no distinction</p>
                <p>It doesn't matter, it's whatever is written</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Please protect me from myself on Judgment day</p>
                <p>I don't even want to imagine the debt I have to pay</p>
                <p>My argument regarding eternal hell</p>
                <p>You know best, but hopefully it'll be made clear to me and everyone before the bell</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Please straighten me out</p>
                <p>My attitude, thoughts, behavior</p>
                <p>Everything that I'm about</p>
                <p>You are the savior</p>
                <p>The source of all that is good</p>
                <p>I pray you prevent me from being rude</p>
                <p>My manners are better!</p>
                <p>Thank you</p>
                    <br>
                <p>My smoking is out of hand</p>
                <p>I've rationalized every reason to stop</p>
                <p>Maybe it's a characteristic of man</p>
                <p>We're better than that, but far from the top</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Things that scare me</p>
                <p>A mountain of good deeds, vanished</p>
                <p>Ingratitude for where ever I may end up, despite knowing everything that happens is based from your judgment, grace, and mercy</p>
                <p>Loss of control over my inner child</p>
                <p>Compliments that don't make sense to me, fear for arrogance</p>
                <p>Absolute mercy and absolute justice. How can I live with myself knowing I don't deserve mercy. How do I accept it graciously. Do I accept it? Is it a test?</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Am I prepared for my consequences? Will I whine, curse, yell, complain, or worst yet, disbelieve, if I don't get what I want? How different would I be? Am I an imposter? I'm asking too many questions. I lack faith, especially in the self. Do you like confidence? How do I avoid arrogance?</p>
                <p>You've blessed me with a degree of awareness and mindfulness, so I can assess myself properly and change accordingly. I still have my flare ups, but I'm doing what I can. I can't say for certain whether I can say it's my best, I can do more. I have no excuses.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Dear God, please bless the ones who have been by my side this whole time. They help me laugh, they help me feel, they've helped me through a lot, though I know it's only by your grace. Help me be kind to people and sincere, the way I am with my peers. I hope to meet them one day on equal terms. I hope it's still fun. I hope they get the chance to say what they like around me. I hope they're comfortable around me.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I don't understand the process.</p>
                <p>I trust your plan. I'm trying to trust timing and be patient.</p>
                <p>I don't understand good and bad. If it's all written, how are we judged? I'm afraid of my thoughts and my questions sometimes. I don't have many people to talk to.. I interpret this negatively. Perhaps I go too far.. you alone fully understand why I feel the need to ask. I don't think I need to know. I just hope I can accept the circumstances fully on Judgment day. That I don't argue or ask too many questions or make suggestions. Who does that in the face of God? I guess we're all a little guilty of that.. possibly my fault. If good deeds spread like a vine, do bad deeds work the same way? Like a weed? They're both plants. I just don't understand is all. Please forgive me for my own insolence and ignorance and misunderstanding.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I apologize for my self doubt. I have no excuses. You've shown me a world of possibilities and somehow I still want to quit sometimes when you test me with the slightest hardship. I'm not very firm or steadfast, but I wanna at least try to make it to the end. I hope I can at least maintain where I'm at now, instead of falling. I apologize for my weakness.</p>
                <p>You know all, and therefore you know best.</p>
                <p>I'll trust you to handle the rest.</p>
