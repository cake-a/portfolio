            <h2>My desk in Gaithersburg @ 18:49, 11/08/2025</h2>
            <p>I sit at this desk every damn day for hours doing absolutely nothing but brainstorm and try to do productive work.</p>
            <p>Today, I decided to work on a portfolio website to display everything I've been working on, so I can feel like I've accomplished something.</p>
            <p>I have a lot of ideas, and while it feels like I'm doing nothing, I'm progressing bit by bit everyday.</p>
            <p>There are days where I feel like I'm regressing, but perhaps it's more positive to think of it as review.</p>
            <p>When trying to learn something, reviewing the fundamentals is always beneficial.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, after review, you may find that doing things is a lot easier than the first try.</p>
            <p>A good lesson to remember is to never give up and aim high.</p>

            <h2>What it means to be an American?</h2>
           <p> To be part of a diverse culture of different races, ethnicities, beliefs, and walks of life.</p>
<br>
            <p> The Native Americans welcomed the first settlers that came to this continent.</p>
            <p> They gave them food, tools, and knowledge on how to perform agriculture on their soil.</p>
<br>
            <p> Though the settlers ended up exploiting their kindness,</p>
            <p> before that, for a brief time, they were living in harmony with them.</p>
<br>
            <p> This was the magic of humanity coming together despite different lifestyles and beliefs.</p>
            <p> We see this today, but in different forms.</p>
<br>
            <p> We have Native Americans, Hispanics, Africans, Asians, Middle Easterns, and Europeans,</p>
            <p> living here together in somewhat of a harmony, despite how imperfect things may be.</p>
<br>
            <p> We wake up, eat breakfast, maybe have a cup of coffee or tea.</p>
            <p> We learn, we work, we make our livings, we come home, and do it all over again the next day.</p>
<br>
            <p> We share a commonality.</p>
            <p> Not only in our lives, but also by the color of our blood and the chemical composition of our sweat.</p>
<br>
            <p> We get sick.</p>
            <p> We get upset.</p>
            <p> We have firm beliefs.</p>
            <p> More importantly, we all have hope for a better tomorrow.</p>
            <p> (Thanks, Rebel Diaz).</p>
<br>
            <p> What does that tomorrow look like?</p>
<br>
            <p> Children playing together in peace.</p>
            <p> Children free to be themselves without judgment or persuasion to be something they're not.</p>
            <p> Children able to pursue their dreams without sacrifice.</p>
            <p> And children able to grow into the best versions of themselves that they can possibly be.</p>
<br>
            <p> This means all children.</p>
            <p> No matter race, ethnicity, or belief system,</p>
            <p> All children deserve to thrive.</p>
<br>
            <p> But what do we see today?</p>
            <p> Racism and xenophobia being taught at early ages, preventing them from making diverse friends and making them afraid of those who are different.</p>
            <p> Adolescents smoking, doing drugs, and becoming gang affiliated.</p>
            <p> Budding adults unable to broaden their knowledge without money, and overwhelming college debt.</p>
            <p> Actual adults working in jobs they don't like just to survive.</p>
            <p> And growing rates of mental illness and suicide.</p>
<br>
            <p> Our baseline situation is far from ideal.</p>
            <p> Red or blue, none of us like what's happening.</p>
            <p> It doesn't have to be this way though.</p>
<br>
            <p> I learned in nursing school that in optimal conditions, no one would get physically or mentally sick.</p>
<br>
            <p> What do optimal conditions look like?</p>
<br>
            <p> Justice, Equality, Freedom, and Opportunity.</p>
<br>
           <p>  Opportunity to thrive, not just survive.</p>
            <p> Freedom to be yourself and grow at your own pace.</p>
            <p> Equal treatment despite race, ethnicity, belief, or socioeconomic status.</p>
            <p> But all this starts with justice.</p>
<br>
           <p>  On some level, we all believe in karma.</p>
            <p> What do you think our karmic credit score looks like, given our country's history?</p>
            <p> We're in debt due to our involvement in death, and destruction of cultures and of people.</p>
            <p> We cannot move forward until we atone for the sins our past.</p>
            <p> If we do move forward without resolving our past, we risk widening the gap.</p>
            <p> The gap between the rich and the poor</p>
            <p> The educated and the uneducated</p>
            <p> The successful and the unsuccessful</p>
            <p> The healthy and the ill.</p>
<br>
           <p>  I have my own subjective views on how things should go,</p>
            <p> but I have no right to impose my beliefs on others.</p>
<br>
            <p> Personally, I believe in a pure democracy where citizens get to vote by how they believe, rather than vote for an equally confused and flawed human being (in other words, representatives) to choose on our behalf.</p>
<br>
           <p>  I'm advocating for reform in a way where red and blue can come together.</p>
           <p>  After all, there are those who are blue that believe in gun rights,</p>
            <p> and there are those who are red that believe in abortion rights,</p>
            <p> and there are those who are neither red or blue, but green.</p>
<br>
            <p> Citizens should not have to sacrifice their values while they vote,</p>
            <p> and the government has a responsibility to ensure that people are able to make a full and informed vote.</p>
<br>
            <p> My proposal, at essence, is for the citizens of America to have the power to choose where their taxes go.</p>
            <p> Only then, can we see what our country truly believes in.</p>
<br>
            <p> So again, what does it mean to be an American?</p>
            <p> To represent your great and unique characteristics in a melting pot,</p>
            <p> while respecting the greatness and uniqueness of others.</p>
<br>
            <p> If we can each do our parts to reach self-representation and respect for others,</p>
            <p> the closer we can get to peace and harmony with one another.</p>
<br>
            <p> The closer we can get to building heaven as a gift for God.</p>
<br>
            <p> My hypothesis goes like this;</p>
            <p> If we can achieve peace here, then we can achieve peace anywhere.</p>

            <h2>Emotions and Morality in the Pursuit of Harmony</h2>
            <p>Humans have emotions and the ability to reason. Emotions serve as an individual indicator towards certain stimuli, while reason can explain whether the reaction is rational or not. Though unreliable, I believe emotions have value in morality. Sympathy towards the oppressed may be deemed rational, while apathy can be seen as irrational. Individual reason by itself may be unreliable due to limitations in perspective. The most knowledgeable intellectuals can still make moral mistakes, such as the case with corrupt politicians or greedy businesspeople. While relying solely on emotion or on reason does not ensure moral action, I believe balance between the two is required for true morality. A moral motive that may encourage individuals towards such balance could be harmony. A definition of harmony would be “a relationship in which various components exist together without destroying one another” (American Heritage Dictionary). This paper will address the importance of emotional awareness for morality and how a collective motive for the sake of harmony can be a motive guided with minimal self-interest.</p>
            <p>Immanuel Kant argued “The practical necessity of acting on this principle of duty does not rest at all on feelings, impulses, or inclinations, but solely on the relation of rational beings to one another…” (Kant, 1785, pg 63). My response to this statement is that the first step to acquire rationality starts with an honest look at our current baseline; that we are emotional beings by default, and assessing the triggers that make us react, positively or negatively, may be important for reaching rationality, and then, making moral decisions. To omit emotion entirely from moral decisions can be viewed as irrational because it ignores a fundamental aspect of the human condition. With emotional awareness, individuals can become rational and independent, then work towards interdependence.</p>
            <p>Today, we face desensitization of our emotions, and we make up various excuses as to why that is. “We are all struggling.” “We have lives to live.” “Our hearts are with you, but we cannot afford to sympathize with the conditions of others.” Wilfred Owen argued that those who are compassionate may suffer considerably, while those who made themselves “immune” from the human condition of empathy are the “losers” (Bennett, 1974, pg 30). Compassion and sincerity are not based on reason, but emotions. Genuine acts of kindness motivated by emotions like that of sympathy may be deemed higher than actions motivated by the strict belief that we must be moral. David Hume stated, “A passion is an original existence, or, if you will, modification of existence, and contains not any representative quality, which renders it a copy of any other existence or modification” (Hume, 1739, pg 42).  The “measure” or interpretation of morality is relative to everyone, but it can be argued from Hume’s perspective that emotions are pure subjective evidence, and therefore, should not be overlooked. Without considering all the evidence available, how would one begin to deduce a moral problem and make wise decisions?</p>
            <p>“We are all struggling to survive.” Before making moral decisions, it seems wise to assess our capabilities and limitations. Nurses assess, diagnose, plan, intervene, then reevaluate for improvement from the original status. This process could be used for moral growth. When addressing limitations, it’s important to start with the achievable. It is my opinion that any moral action, no matter the intention or motive, has a degree of weight towards progress. Psychological egoism is “the view that the only reason or motive for any action is self-interest” (Brody, 1977, pg 13). Self-interest involves action for a personal advantage and, typically, has a negative connotation related to self-inflation from moral actions. Self-preservation, on the other hand, refers to the maintenance and safety of an individual's wellbeing. I argue that self-preservation is morally acceptable, and that self-interested moral motives for the sake of self-preservation may remain in fact moral and beneficial for humanity. The stigma comes from the judgment of others that believe that it is not moral enough, and although just a possibility, it may be healthier to assume that everyone is doing their best.</p>
            <p>“We have lives to live.” There is a slippery slope between prioritizing the self versus others. Voltaire has a philosophy arguing that “we must cultivate our garden” (Voltaire, 1759). Meaning, focus on what is within our control and mind our own business. This may be plausible for some. Perhaps if we follow Voltaire’s philosophy, we’d be better off individually. However, to ignore the fact that we are one part of a whole species fighting to survive the environment around us would be unwise. We are social beings living together in the same time period. Teamwork can be found throughout several species in the animal kingdom where there is a common goal for survival. The question arises, what is our common goal? John Stuart Mill’s argument for utilitarianism is that morality should be based on the level of happiness for the whole since all people desire happiness (Mill, 1861, pg 66). My response to Mill’s argument is that the road to happiness may not always be moral. Immoral actions can also lead to a level of happiness, such as the human sacrifice for utility concept proposed by Onora O’Neill, as if human sacrifice is morally permissible for any reason under any circumstances. (O’Neill, 1986 , pg 82). It is my opinion that a common goal for us could possibly be harmony, which may contribute to Mill’s idea of utilized happiness.</p>
            <p>“Our hearts are with you, but we cannot afford to sympathize with the conditions of others.” In this case, empathy is present, but circumstances make it difficult to focus on others. Unfortunately, not everyone gets the opportunity to act in the way they like and I’m afraid there are limitations within our society that prevent us from acting as freely as we should. This is a reality for some. Say, the situation of conflicting political views between family members. When given the privilege to act morally, I believe we must be swift and confident in our actions for the benefit of ourselves and others.</p>
            <p>Concerning empathy, is genuine and sincere emotion enough to be considered a moral action? It seems to me that it is the spark towards moral action.  The synapses in our nervous system that create emotion contain energy, which may drive us towards such action(s). Energy contains power to cause movement. Therefore, the energy to speak, move, and express ourselves has a level of influence. The transfer of this type of energy can form into some type of movement, action, or change. I don’t know much else. My response to the sentiment that “our hearts are with you,” is that this may hold value. The Law of Conservation states that energy is never lost, but changes. We are a mesh of atomic particles emitting positive or negative charges through expression of emotions, which may possibly benefit us to some fraction of a degree. My logic goes like this, if such outward expression of emotions requires power and energy to produce, then the transfer of such energy must go somewhere within our vacuum of life. To feel and express ourselves may be better than to not project at all.</p>
            <p>When addressing the morality of motives found in religion, such as emphasizing a karmic credit score that can help us win the lottery, I believe in the possibility that the pathway towards heaven or hell, shame or honor, could be a collective effort. Assuming we cannot trust the scriptures to accurately depict the word of God, we can take a step back and assume any possibility regarding the “rules” through what seems rational under an all-powerful, all knowing, and all beneficent God. After all, even if one achieves heaven, could a moral individual accept it while the peers that helped them reach that point, regardless of what they did, don’t end up in the same conditions? Perhaps this gives a moral motive for some to convert others, but how does one uplift another towards an honorable life deemed acceptable by themselves, others, and possibly even God? Philosophers have wrestled with various versions of the same question. Paternalism, force, or manipulation are immoral methods, and therefore should not be used, even for the sake of the greater good.</p>
            <p>I believe helping one understand their individuality can be a step towards understanding where they fit in the bigger picture. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “I am part or particle of God” (Emerson, 1836). Religious individuals may realize that others are particles of God as well, no matter how damned they may seem. Harmony does not mean that everyone is playing the same note or instrument. We must learn to accept everyone’s unique characteristics and find their proper place within the orchestra of life. If God’s will is indeed good and perfect, everyone has a role to play in the development of our morality as a whole. Achieving harmony could be the greatest gift from us to God.</p>
            <p>But perhaps I go too far. Control over our emotions requires time and effort, and harmony is not easy to attain, even within our own social circles. We do, in fact, live in an overwhelmingly connected yet isolated society. We are conditioned to ignore a lot of what occurs due to various factors, such as advertisements, false news, and social media. Prioritization of where our energy and emotions go seems difficult when there is a substantial number of events that occur on a day-to-day basis. Overstimulation has led to desensitization, to the point that some of us cannot assess our reality accurately or connect with others, or even ourselves, on a deeper level. We can only rely on our sliver of experience and perspective from the whole, if such an absolute truth exists.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, like many others, I have no answers. Only ideas, beliefs, and arguments supporting my perspective towards consideration of our emotions when approaching moral decisions, as well as a collective moral motive towards harmony and peace. Only our free will can decide when to feel empathy for others. It all takes time, which we unfortunately don’t have a lot of. I’m hoping that with higher literacy rates than ever presented in history, we can achieve harmony through “moral education” (Arthur, 1995, pg 23). That being, learning from various philosophical, religious, cultural, and political perspectives as a means to widen our own perspective, become more accepting and understanding of others, and, God willing, achieve peace.</p>
